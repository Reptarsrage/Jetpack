3-24-14 Just making initial changes/commits playing around with opengl and fltk.
3-25-14 Finished with loading textures/sprites, moving on to playing around with controls and animation.
3-30-14 Taking a break from creating things, starting to add a level editor
4-3-14 Level editor up and running, returning to adding things.
4-5-14 Stopping adding things, to fix issues that developed with inheritance.
4-6-14 Starting to implement ground properties, and moving ladders/conveyors.
4-9-14 Going to begin work on phasing through solid blocks.


Bugs (not comprehensive)
Baddies caught in solids freak out
editor does not know which objects can be placed on top of others
door is really small
baddies not effected by ground or moving ladders
bat is really lame/too difficult
no teleportation delay
some of the objects' bounds are not right
things not centered on ladder or on startup
