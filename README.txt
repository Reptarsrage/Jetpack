5-10-14 (Always forgetting to update this, sorry) Finished load + save and some other UI stuff, I'm
		going to start working on getting a campaign mode up and running, as of now you can only edit and play levels.

Bugs (not comprehensive)
Baddies caught in solids freak out
editor does not know which objects can be placed on top of others (FIXED)
door is really small
baddies not effected by ground or moving ladders
bat is really lame/too difficult
no teleportation delay
some of the objects' bounds are not right
things not centered on ladder or on startup	(FIXED FOR HERO)
hero freaks out sometimes on corners (FIXED)
hero cannot phase on ladders
